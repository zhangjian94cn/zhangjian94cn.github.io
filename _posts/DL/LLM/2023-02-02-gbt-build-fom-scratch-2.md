### Building the "self-attention"

#### version 1: averaging past context with for loops, the weakest form of aggregation


#### the trick in self-attention: matrix multiply as weighted aggregation


#### version 2: using matrix multiply


#### version 3: adding softmax



#### minor code cleanup


#### positional encoding


#### THE CRUX OF THE VIDEO: version 4: self-attention


#### Some Notes

Notes:
- Attention is a communication mechanism. Can be seen as nodes in a directed graph looking at each other and aggregating information with a weighted sum from all nodes that point to them, with data-dependent weights.
- There is no notion of space. Attention simply acts over a set of vectors. This is why we need to positionally encode tokens.
- Each example across batch dimension is of course processed completely independently and never "talk" to each other
- In an "encoder" attention block just delete the single line that does masking with tril, allowing all tokens to communicate. This block here is called a "decoder" attention block because it has triangular masking, and is usually used in autoregressive settings, like language modeling.
- "self-attention" just means that the keys and values are produced from the same source as queries. In "cross-attention", the queries still get produced from x, but the keys and values come from some other, external source (e.g. an encoder module)
- "Scaled" attention additional divides wei by 1/sqrt(head_size). This makes it so when input Q,K are unit variance, wei will be unit variance too and Softmax will stay diffuse and not saturate too much. Illustration below


### Building the Transformer

#### inserting a single self-attention block to our network

#### multi-headed self-attention

#### feedforward layers of transformer block

#### residual connections

#### layernorm (and its relationship to our previous batchnorm)

#### scaling up the model! creating a few variables. adding dropout
